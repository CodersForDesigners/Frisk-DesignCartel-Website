	The Floating Table Office
	One of the first projects we designed, which was also one of our most ambitious. The clients were looking for an innovative and unique design that mirrored their cutting edge ethos, and our entire concept was built around the idea of the suspended table. We re-engineered the work tables by cutting out the legs and suspending them from the ceiling, vastly enhancing workplace interactions. 

	The rest of our design was based around this central idea, with spaces taking on their own character, and functions fitting in around this new layout. We managed to use design changes and innovative thinking to create an office that was unique and thought-provoking, all on a conservative budget.
